# How HarmonyBuilder (Professional) Can Boost Your Music Composition Skills
 
If you are a composer, an arranger, a teacher or a student of music, you might be interested in HarmonyBuilder (Professional), a smart music composition software that helps you build perfectly harmonized melodies and chord progressions. HarmonyBuilder (Professional) is more than just a music notation software. It is also a powerful tool for generating and exploring musical ideas, learning music theory and harmony, and improving your voice-leading and modulation skills.
 
HarmonyBuilder (Professional) combines the power of automated error-checking with the convenience of smart composition tools, like the Chord Selector wheel and the Voicing Generator. The Builder panel allows you to develop your compositions either harmonically, by following the chord progression pathways suggested by the software, or melodically, by selecting from the menu of all chord options that harmonize a given melody or bass note. Either way, the end result will be perfectly voiced chord progressions that match your chosen melody line, bass line or modulation requirements. You can also specify chord inversions and note doublings.

2. Choose the key signature, time signature, tempo and instrument for your composition from the menus at the top of the screen. You can also adjust the zoom level and the playback volume from the toolbar.
3. Start composing by using the Builder panel at the bottom of the screen. You can choose between three approaches: harmonic, melodic or figured bass. The harmonic approach lets you create a chord progression by following the suggestions of the Chord Selector wheel and the Routing Arrows. The melodic approach lets you harmonize a melody or a bass line by selecting from the menu of all chord options that match a given note. The figured bass approach lets you enter a figured bass line and have the software generate the corresponding chords[^3^].
4. For each chord, you can specify the inversion, note doubling, voicing and position by using the buttons and sliders in the Builder panel. You can also apply various filters to eliminate chord options that are not desirable or correct, such as voice-crossing, parallel fifths and octaves, out-of-range notes, etc. These filters are based on the same rules and restrictions that are checked and marked in HarmonyBuilder (Educational) version[^3^].
5. Once you have chosen a chord option, you can add it to your score by clicking the Add button. You can also edit, delete or move any chord in your score by using the mouse or keyboard commands. You can also copy and paste large segments of music inside your score[^2^].
6. You can embellish your composition by adding passing notes, suspensions, ornamentation and other musical devices by using the buttons in the Nomenclature panel. You can also modulate to different keys by using the Modulation button in the Builder panel[^3^].
7. You can play back your composition by clicking the Play button in the toolbar. You can also export your composition as a MIDI file or a PDF file by using the File menu.

As you can see, HarmonyBuilder (Professional) is a very versatile and powerful software that can help you compose music in a fast and easy way. You can also learn a lot from it by seeing how different chords and voicings work together to create harmonious music.
