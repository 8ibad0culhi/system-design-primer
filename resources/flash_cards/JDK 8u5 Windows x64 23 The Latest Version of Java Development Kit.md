JDK 8u5 is an older version of the Java Development Kit that was released in April 2014. It is not recommended for use in production, as it does not have the latest security patches and features. However, some developers may need to use it for testing or compatibility purposes. In this article, we will show you how to install JDK 8u5 on Windows 10 x64.
 
## Step 1: Download JDK 8u5
 
You can download JDK 8u5 from the Oracle Java Archive[^2^]. You will need an oracle.com account to access the archive. If you don't have one, you can register for free on the top of the page. Once you have logged in, scroll down to the section "Java SE Development Kit 8u202" and click on the link for "Windows x64". This will download a file named jdk-8u202-windows-x64.exe with a size of 211.58 MB.

## Step 2: Run the installer
 
After the download is complete, double-click on the file to launch the installer. You may see a security warning asking you if you want to run this file. Click on "Run" to proceed. The installer will display a welcome screen and ask you to accept the license agreement. Read the agreement carefully and click on "Accept" if you agree. Then, choose a destination folder for the installation. The default location is C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\_202. You can change it if you want, but make sure you have enough space on your disk. Click on "Next" to continue.
 
## Step 3: Configure the environment variables
 
After the installation is finished, you will need to configure some environment variables to use JDK 8u5 from the command line. To do this, open the Control Panel and click on "System and Security". Then, click on "System" and then on "Advanced system settings". This will open a window with several tabs. Click on the "Advanced" tab and then on the "Environment Variables" button. This will open another window with two lists of variables: one for your user account and one for the system.
 
In the user variables list, click on "New" to create a new variable. In the name field, type JAVA\_HOME and in the value field, type the path to your JDK installation folder (for example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\_202). Click on "OK" to save the variable.
 
In the system variables list, find the variable named Path and click on "Edit". This will open a window with a list of paths separated by semicolons. Add a new path at the end of the list that points to your JDK bin folder (for example, C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0\_202\bin). Make sure there is a semicolon before and after your path. Click on "OK" to save the changes.
 
Click on "OK" again to close all the windows.
 
## Step 4: Verify the installation
 
To verify that JDK 8u5 is installed correctly and working, open a command prompt and type java -version. You should see something like this:
