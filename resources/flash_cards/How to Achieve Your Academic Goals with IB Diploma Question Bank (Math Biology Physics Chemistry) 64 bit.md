One of the best ways to prepare for the IB exams is to use question banks, which are collections of past exam questions organized by topic and level. Question banks can help you practice your skills, test your knowledge, identify your strengths and weaknesses, and familiarize yourself with the exam format and style.
 
There are different types of question banks available for IB students, depending on the subject and the level. Some of the most popular ones are:
 
- **IB Questionbank**: This is the official question bank from the IB organization, which contains questions from previous exams for all subjects and levels. You can access it online or download it to your computer. You can also create your own tests, filter questions by criteria, and print or export them. To use this question bank, you need to purchase a licence through Follett Titlewave[^2^].
- **Diploma sample exam papers**: These are examples of actual examination papers used in past years for all subjects and levels. They are provided by the IB organization for information only. You can download them for free from their website[^1^]. However, they do not include mark schemes or model answers.
- **Save My Exams**: This is a website that offers question banks for various subjects and levels, as well as revision notes, model answers, mark schemes, and tips. You can access some of the resources for free, but you need to pay a subscription fee to access all of them[^3^].

Using question banks can help you boost your confidence and performance in the IB exams. However, you should also complement them with other study methods, such as reviewing your notes, doing homework assignments, reading textbooks, watching videos, taking mock exams, and asking for feedback from your teachers and peers.
 
Good luck with your IB exams!

Using question banks can be a great way to revise for your IB exams, but you need to use them wisely and strategically. Here are some tips on how to do that:

- **Plan your revision schedule**: You should start using question banks early in your revision process, not just before the exam. You should also allocate enough time for each subject and topic, and balance your practice with other study methods.
- **Focus on your weak areas**: You should use question banks to identify and work on your weak areas, not just to confirm what you already know. You should analyze your mistakes and gaps in knowledge, and seek help if needed.
- **Vary your practice**: You should use question banks to practice different types of questions, such as multiple choice, short answer, extended response, data analysis, etc. You should also practice under different conditions, such as timed or untimed, open book or closed book, etc.
- **Review your progress**: You should use question banks to monitor and evaluate your progress over time. You should keep track of your scores, accuracy, speed, and confidence. You should also celebrate your achievements and reward yourself for your hard work.
