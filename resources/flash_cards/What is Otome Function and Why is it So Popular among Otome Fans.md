Otome Function has been delayed several times due to various reasons, such as changing partners, downsizing the project, and fixing bugs. The game was originally planned to be released in 2010, but as of 2023, it is still not available to the public. However, Mu Soft has released some demos and teasers over the years, showing the progress and potential of the game. The latest demo was released in 2019, which allowed the player to move the soft parts of the girl's body.
 
Otome Function has attracted a lot of attention and anticipation from fans of touching games, who have been following its development for over a decade. Some have even compared it to the race between Skyrim 6 and Otome Function, joking about which one will come out first. Otome Function is considered to be an evolution of Mu Soft's previous game Hizashi no Naka no Rairu, which was also a popular touching game that was not allowed on some platforms due to its content.
 
Otome Function is expected to feature four main girls: Kousaka Rino, Mochizuki Nonoka, Tatiana Vasilievna Stalina, and Kisaragi Rei. Each girl has her own personality, voice, and scenario. The player can choose which girl to interact with and explore different options and outcomes. Otome Function is also said to have some story elements and choices that affect the relationship with the girls.

However, Otome Function is not without its challenges and controversies. The game has been criticized by some for its content, which involves touching underage girls in suggestive ways. The game has also been flagged by some antivirus software as potentially harmful, due to its use of a custom engine that may trigger false positives. The game has also faced some legal issues, such as the dispute between Mu Soft and Sky Rockets, the former partner company that was supposed to publish the game.
 
Despite these difficulties, Otome Function is still a game that has a loyal fan base and a dedicated developer. Mu Soft has been working on the game for over 15 years, and has not given up on its vision. Mu Soft has also been communicating with the fans through their website and social media, providing updates and feedback.
