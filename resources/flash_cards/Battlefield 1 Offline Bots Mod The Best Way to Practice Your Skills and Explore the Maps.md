Battlefield 1 is a popular first-person shooter game that takes place during World War I. It features large-scale battles with up to 64 players on various maps and modes.

A bot mod is a modification that adds artificial intelligence (AI) controlled soldiers to the game, allowing players to play against them in offline mode. This way, players can practice their skills, explore the maps, or just have fun without any pressure or competition. Unfortunately, Battlefield 1 does not have an official bot mod, but there is a fan-made one that works well.
 
The bot mod for Battlefield 1 is created by a user named Zloty on ModDB and GitHub. It is still in development, but it already supports several maps and modes, such as Conquest, Rush, Team Deathmatch, and War Pigeons. The mod also allows players to customize the number and difficulty of the bots, as well as their weapons and appearance. The mod is compatible with both the base game and the DLCs.
 
To install and use the bot mod for Battlefield 1, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the latest version of the mod from ModDB[^2^] or GitHub[^1^]. You will get a zip file containing the mod files.
2. Extract the zip file to your Battlefield 1 installation folder. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Battlefield 1.
3. Run the game and go to Options > Video. Set your resolution scale to 100% and disable DirectX 12. This is necessary for the mod to work properly.
4. Go back to the main menu and select Offline Play. Choose your desired map and mode and start the match.
5. Enjoy playing Battlefield 1 offline with bots!

Note that the bot mod is not supported by EA or DICE, and it may cause some bugs or crashes. Use it at your own risk and make sure to backup your game files before installing it. Also, do not use the mod online, as it may result in a ban from Origin or Battlelog.
