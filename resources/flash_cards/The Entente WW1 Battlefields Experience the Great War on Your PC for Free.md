# The Entente WW1 Battlefields: A Free PC Game Review
 
If you are a fan of historical strategy games, you might want to check out The Entente WW1 Battlefields, a free PC game that lets you relive the battles of the First World War. The game features four playable factions: Russia, France, Germany and Great Britain, each with their own units, weapons and tactics. You can choose from several scenarios, such as the Western Front, the Eastern Front, the Balkans and the Middle East, or create your own custom maps and missions. The game also supports multiplayer mode, where you can challenge other players online or via LAN.
 
The Entente WW1 Battlefields is not a very demanding game in terms of graphics or system requirements, but it still offers a decent level of realism and detail. The game uses a 3D engine that allows you to zoom in and out of the battlefield, rotate the camera and view the action from different angles. The sound effects and music are also well done, creating an immersive atmosphere. The game mechanics are easy to learn but hard to master, as you have to balance your resources, manage your troops and plan your strategies carefully. The game also has a historical mode, where you can follow the actual events of the war and see how your actions affect the outcome.
