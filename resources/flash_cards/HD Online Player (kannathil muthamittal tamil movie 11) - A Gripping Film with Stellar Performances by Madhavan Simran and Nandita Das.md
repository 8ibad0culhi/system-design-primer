The film begins with the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by a suicide bomber belonging to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist militant group in Sri Lanka. The bomber is revealed to be Shyama (Nandita Das), a young Tamil woman who was forcibly recruited by the LTTE after her husband Dileepan (J. D. Chakravarthy) was killed by the Sri Lankan army.
 
Nine years later, in Chennai, India, we meet Thiruchelvan (R. Madhavan) and Indira (Simran), a happily married couple who work as writers. They have three children: Amudha (P. S. Keerthana), Vinay (Siddharth) and Akhilan (Vignesh). On Amudha's ninth birthday, Thiruchelvan and Indira reveal to her that she is adopted and that her biological mother is Shyama, who gave her up as an infant during the civil war in Sri Lanka.
 
Amudha is shocked and angry by this revelation and demands to meet her birth mother. Thiruchelvan and Indira agree to take her to Sri Lanka, where they hope to find Shyama with the help of Dr. Herold Vikramasinghe (Prakash Raj), a friend and colleague of Thiruchelvan who works for an NGO in the war zone. However, their journey is fraught with danger and uncertainty as they encounter various obstacles and challenges along the way.
 
Meanwhile, Shyama is still alive and active in the LTTE, under the alias of Malar. She is unaware of her daughter's existence and is loyal to the cause of Tamil Eelam. She is also romantically involved with Thileepan (Pasupathy), a senior LTTE commander who is like a brother to her. As the war intensifies, Shyama and Thileepan face increasing pressure from their leader Velupillai Prabhakaran (P. Sreekumar) to carry out more attacks and sacrifices for the movement.
 
The film explores the themes of identity, family, love, war and peace through the perspectives of the main characters. It also showcases the culture, history and politics of Sri Lanka and its impact on the Tamil people. The film features a musical score by A. R. Rahman and lyrics by Vairamuthu. The songs are sung by various artists, including Chinmayi, Hariharan, Jayachandran, Madhushree, Sadhana Sargam and Srinivas.
