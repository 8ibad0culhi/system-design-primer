1. Go to the Microsoft Update Catalog website[^5^] and search for "DAVICOM". You will see a list of drivers for different Davicom devices and Windows versions.
2. Find the driver that matches your device and Windows version. For example, if you have a DAVICOM 9102/A PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter and you are using Windows 7 x64, you can choose the driver with the following description: "DAVICOM - Network - DAVICOM 9102/A PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter - Windows 7,Windows Server 2008 R2".
3. Click on the "Download" button next to the driver and save the .cab file to your computer.
4. Extract the .cab file using a tool like 7-Zip or WinRAR. You will get a folder with several files inside.
5. Open the Device Manager on your computer. You can do this by right-clicking on the Start menu and selecting "Device Manager", or by following the instructions for your specific Windows version[^2^].
6. Locate your Davicom DM9102AF network card under the "Network adapters" category. It may have a yellow exclamation mark or a generic name like "Ethernet Controller".
7. Right-click on your network card and select "Update driver software".
8. Choose "Browse my computer for driver software" and then "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer".
9. Click on the "Have Disk" button and browse to the folder where you extracted the .cab file. Select the .inf file that corresponds to your device and click "Open". For example, if you have a DAVICOM 9102/A PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter, you should select the file named "DM9PCI.inf".
10. Click "OK" and then "Next". The driver installation will start and you may see some warnings or prompts. Follow the instructions on the screen and click "Yes" or "Install" when asked.
11. When the installation is complete, click "Close" and restart your computer if required.
