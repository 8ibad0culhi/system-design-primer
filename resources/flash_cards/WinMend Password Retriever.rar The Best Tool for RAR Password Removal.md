WinMend Folder Hidden is a user-friendly program that allows you to hide your files and folders from prying eyes. You can easily drag and drop any file or folder to the program window and make it invisible in a few seconds. You can also change the visibility status of your files and folders in the same window by clicking on them. You can sort your hidden objects by name, size, type or date and perform batch operations on multiple items at once. If you hide files on a USB drive using this program, they will stay hidden even if you plug the drive into another computer. However, you will need to install the WinMend Folder Hidden and enter the master password on that computer to access them. The master password is a security feature that you set up when you first launch the program and that you need to enter every time you open it. The program does not have any password recovery systems, so it is very important that you remember (or write down) your password and keep it safe. Otherwise, you might lose access to your hidden files forever.
